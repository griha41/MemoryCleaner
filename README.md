# MemoryCleaner
## About this:
This software have an easy way to free memory in Windows systems.
It works allocating all non-used memory in the system to occupy all "pending" memory, after that, it frees all the allocated memory to let it completely free, not "half-free, half-pending-to-free".

## Using the software:
There are compiled binaries to use in 32-bit and 64-bit Windows machines in addition to the single C++ source file.
It's about 50 lines of real code, it's simple but powerful.
Download binaries here, and look inside of the repository to get the code.

* Download 64-bit binary: [MemCleaner64.exe](https://github.com/josemicoronil/MemoryCleaner/raw/master/MemCleaner64.exe)

* Download 32-bit binary: [MemCleaner32.exe](https://github.com/josemicoronil/MemoryCleaner/raw/master/MemCleaner32.exe)

## What happens on non-Windows machines:
Their memory management works in a different way, so I don't think this software would be useful for you, but hey, you are free to try it out, it wouldn't do anything bad. I promise.
